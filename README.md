# MATLAB-Code
These two MATLAB codes are used for video processing and light intensity calculation used in the Nature Communications publication "Highly robust and soft biohybrid mechanoluminescence for optical signaling and illumination".
The first file entitled with "Video_Processing" is used to extract frames from the experimental video.
The second file entitled with "Light_Intensity" is used to convert colorful above frames into grayscales format and then calculate the light intensity based on grayscales.
Any questions concernd with these two codes can be corresponded to Chenghai Li (chl050@ucsd.edu).
